# Website-Template
Website template for noobs

This simple Website Template has been created for people that maybe might not have the time or the knowledge of coding a website. Instead of using a wysiwyg editor to create a website I have used the three main coding languages for web development: HTML, CSS and JS. HTML is not an actual programming language but we ignore that, HTML uses elements to create websites for example if you want a header you would do <h1> to achieve that, then CSS is used for styling the various HTML elements, and finnally JS is used to achieve stuff like toggling visibility in HTML elements or making something a paerticular way that cant be achieved with the other two languages. I also used NodeJS for this template to host the website on a server, NodeJS is used for backend code which  allows you to create working contact forms or uses data-bases in your website. I used the Repl.it editor to create this.
