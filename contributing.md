Feel free to add whatever you like, its still a work in progress and certain things need to be improved like the footer or the image placment, 

<h1> What is this template </h1>
  â€¢ Its a template to be used for simple stuff like a company website or a blog, its not too hard to use with some basic knowledge of html, 
    I did not comment the code as yet, I did not have time to do it but will work on it as soon as I can.
  
 <h1> Contributing </h1>
  As I said improve certain stuff like the styling or html elements, feel free to completly change stuff please do give credit but in all honesty I just did it
  for fun, report stuff like bugs etc,
  
  <h1> Info on the website </h1>
      Its coded in HTML, CSS, JS and NodeJS, certain stuff like the contact services are yet to be implemnted fully, its a basic lightmode theme (dark-mode to be
      implmented soon) as I said I will add comments to the code to make it easier to understand the code, it uses just one css file (theres another file but thats 
      going to be removed) not overly complx and uses very little code, (as I have said many times its still a wip)
      
   any questions feel free to ask
